 ## Details
 This module is working primarily on a cosmetic level as it's just renaming the 5e currencies as follows:


5e Default| |Dark Sun
--- | --- | ---
Platinum|-->|Gold
Gold|-->|Silver
Electrum|-->|*REMOVED*
Silver|-->|Ceramic
Copper|-->|Bits
     
In addition to the renaming and hiding of currencies the conversion button's formula has been altered to match the correct values for Dark Sun.
